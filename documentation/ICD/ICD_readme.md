Not sure if an ICD is necessary as the pinion diagram already make it possible to assign to eachpin they roles quite clearly
Maybe a simple spreadsheet or table linking software name of pin to actaul pins name and function maybe usefull.
But the heavy ICD template seem like unnecessary work and documentation.
